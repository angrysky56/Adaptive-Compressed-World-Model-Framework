# Adaptive Compressed World Model Framework

This repository implements an Adaptive Compressed World Model Framework that efficiently manages complex, dynamic information using compression techniques, event-triggered updates, and adaptive context linking.

## Overview

The Adaptive Compressed World Model Framework provides an efficient, scalable, and flexible solution for managing world models in multi-agent systems. It addresses the challenges of real-time processing, context retention, and efficient resource use in complex environments.

Key components:
- **Compressed Context Packs**: Compact, semantically rich representations of world states
- **Event-Triggered Updates**: Mechanisms that update context only when relevant changes occur
- **Dynamic Context Linking**: Context packs are interconnected for efficient on-demand retrieval
- **Intelligent of Agents (IoA) Monitoring**: Meta-analysis of agent behaviors and knowledge convergence

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Dependencies (install via pip):
  - numpy
  - networkx
  - redis
  - torch
  - transformers
  - matplotlib
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - scipy

### Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Adaptive-Compressed-World-Model-Framework.git
cd Adaptive-Compressed-World-Model-Framework

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the package in development mode
pip install -e .
```

### Running a Basic Simulation

```python
import asyncio
from acwmf.simulation import SimulationEnvironment, Agent
from acwmf.monitoring import IoAMonitor

async def main():
    # Create simulation environment
    sim = SimulationEnvironment()
    
    # Add agents and resources
    # ...
    
    # Create IoA monitor
    monitor = IoAMonitor(sim)
    
    # Run simulation with monitoring
    # ...
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Features

- **Efficiency**: Compression reduces memory and storage requirements
- **Adaptability**: Event-triggered updates minimize processing load
- **Scalability**: Dynamically expands as complexity increases
- **Contextual Awareness**: Retains and retrieves context as needed
- **Meta-Analysis**: Monitors knowledge convergence and agent behavior patterns
