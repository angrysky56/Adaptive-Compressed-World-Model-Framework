# Development Guide

This document outlines the development practices, standards, and workflow for the Adaptive Compressed World Model Framework project.

## Development Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Adaptive-Compressed-World-Model-Framework.git
   cd Adaptive-Compressed-World-Model-Framework
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -e .  # Install the package in development mode
   ```

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a branch for your feature or bugfix**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make changes and add tests**:
   - Implement your changes in the appropriate modules
   - Add tests to ensure your changes work as expected
   - Document your code with docstrings

3. **Run tests locally**:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover tests
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of your changes"
   ```

5. **Push your branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a pull request** for review

## Coding Standards

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) coding style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Include docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Include appropriate error handling

## Documentation

- Update documentation when making significant changes
- Document the theoretical basis of your implementation
- Include examples for new features
- Maintain up-to-date API documentation

## Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Include integration tests for component interactions
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Aim for high test coverage

## Dependencies

- When adding a new dependency, update both `requirements.txt` and `setup.py`
- Consider the impact of new dependencies on the project's portability
- Use widely supported and actively maintained libraries

## Version Control

- Keep commits focused on a single change or feature
- Write clear commit messages
- Reference issue numbers in commit messages when applicable
- Squash or rebase commits before merging to maintain a clean history

## Release Process

1. Update version number in `setup.py`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
3. Tag the release in git
4. Create a GitHub release
5. Upload to PyPI (if applicable)
