# Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the Adaptive Compressed World Model Framework architecture, detailing the main components and their interactions.

## System Components

The framework consists of three primary systems that work together:

1. **Knowledge Representation System**
2. **Multi-Agent Simulation Environment**
3. **Intelligence of Agents (IoA) Monitoring System**

These systems are designed to be both independent and interoperable, allowing flexibility in how they're used.

## 1. Knowledge Representation System

### Core Components

#### CompressedContextPack

Handles the compression and expansion of knowledge contexts:

- Compresses text into dense vector representations
- Preserves critical entities during compression
- Provides expansion capabilities for retrieving detailed information
- Uses transformer models for embedding generation

#### DynamicContextGraph

Manages relationships between context packs:

- Stores context packs as nodes in a graph structure
- Creates links based on semantic similarity
- Enables traversal and expansion of related contexts
- Calculates relevance between different contexts

#### EventTriggerSystem

Controls when updates and expansions occur:

- Monitors changes in the environment and agent states
- Uses adaptive thresholds to determine when updates are necessary
- Records event history to adjust thresholds over time
- Prevents unnecessary updates to optimize resources

#### StorageHierarchy

Manages the hierarchical storage of context packs:

- Implements caching for frequently accessed contexts
- Handles long-term storage for less frequently used data
- Provides pruning mechanisms to remove outdated or irrelevant contexts
- Optimizes retrieval speed based on access patterns

### Data Flow

1. Raw data enters the system via the `add_knowledge` method
2. The data is compressed into a context pack
3. The context pack is added to the graph and storage systems
4. Relationships to existing contexts are calculated and established
5. Access to the knowledge occurs through queries or direct expansion
6. Updates are triggered by significant changes detected by the event system

## 2. Multi-Agent Simulation Environment

![Simulation Environment Architecture](../docs/images/simulation_architecture.png)

### Core Components

#### SimulationEnvironment

Manages the overall simulation:

- Maintains the current environment state
- Coordinates agent interactions
- Handles resource creation and management
- Implements the simulation loop

#### Agent

Represents an individual agent with its own world model:

- Perceives the environment within its perception radius
- Makes decisions based on its internal world model
- Takes actions that affect the environment
- Updates its world model based on new perceptions

#### EnvironmentState

Tracks the current state of the simulation:

- Stores entity and resource positions and properties
- Provides methods to find entities and resources within a radius
- Handles updates to the environment

### Interaction Flow

1. Each simulation step begins with agents perceiving their environment
2. Agents decide on actions based on their world models
3. Actions are executed, affecting the environment state
4. The environment updates based on actions and internal rules
5. This cycle repeats for each time step

## 3. Intelligence of Agents (IoA) Monitoring System

![IoA Monitoring Architecture](../docs/images/ioa_architecture.png)

### Core Components

#### IoAMonitor

The central monitoring component:

- Observes the simulation state at each time step
- Analyzes agent behaviors and knowledge convergence
- Generates insights based on patterns detected
- Visualizes results through various graph representations

#### Convergence Analysis

Examines how agent knowledge evolves:

- Compares world models across agents
- Calculates similarity matrices
- Tracks convergence over time
- Identifies patterns in knowledge development

#### Behavior Analysis

Tracks and categorizes agent behaviors:

- Analyzes movement patterns
- Identifies exploration strategies
- Detects resource interaction patterns
- Classifies behaviors into categories

### Analysis Flow

1. The monitor observes the simulation at regular intervals
2. Agent behaviors and world models are analyzed
3. Convergence metrics are calculated and tracked
4. Insights are generated based on observed patterns
5. Results are visualized through graphs and charts

## System Integration

The three systems work together in the following ways:

1. **Agents use the Knowledge Representation System** to maintain their world models
2. **The Simulation Environment** provides the context in which agents interact
3. **The IoA Monitor** observes both the agents and the environment
4. **Insights from the IoA Monitor** can inform changes to agent behavior or knowledge representation

This integrated approach allows for studying how knowledge representations evolve and converge in multi-agent systems, providing a testbed for theories about intelligence and knowledge.

## Extension Points

The framework is designed to be extensible in several ways:

1. **Custom Agent Implementations**: Create agents with different behaviors or learning strategies
2. **Alternative Compression Methods**: Implement different approaches to knowledge compression
3. **New Environment Types**: Develop various simulation environments with different dynamics
4. **Additional Analysis Metrics**: Create new ways to measure convergence or agent performance
5. **Domain-Specific Adaptations**: Adjust the framework for specific application domains

## Technical Considerations

- **Asynchronous Processing**: The framework uses async/await patterns for non-blocking operations
- **Memory Management**: Careful attention to memory usage, especially for large simulations
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle increasing numbers of agents and environment complexity
- **Visualization**: Includes tools for visualizing complex relationships and patterns
